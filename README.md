The keylogger project is a software program that records every keystroke made on
a computer. This includes all text typed into applications, passwords, and other
sensitive information. The purpose of the project is to provide a tool for monitoring
computer activity, particularly in cases where there may be concern about
unauthorized access or use of a computer system.
The keylogger project involves the development of a software program that can be
installed on a computer. Once installed, the program runs in the background and
records all keystrokes made on the computer. The recorded data is then stored in
a log file that can be reviewed at a later time. The project also involves the
development of a user interface for accessing and reviewing the log files.
